Let me try another time, in case someone can give it a go...I have: Drive 1 SSD EXT3 14G has /boot and /, Drive 2 SATA NTFS 500G has windows, files, and some opt software that is too big to keep on my /. Unity3D is on my 500G SATA, and needs a specific set of permissions to run; Can I, in any way fool Unity3D into thinking those permissions are set? Can I, for example, symlink every file from 
2016-02-05 23:25:58	xananax	my SATA to my main drive and set permissions on the symlinks there? Can I mount the NTFS drive with specific per-file permissions? Is there anything I can do?

2016-02-06 23:50:16	vimes	I have them all on one SSD 
2016-02-06 23:50:24	grawity	bah, I could've just said `fdisk -l /dev/sda`
2016-02-06 23:50:31	grawity	which just says "EFI System"
2016-02-06 23:50:37	sudokode	heh
2016-02-06 23:50:38	GaivsIvlivs	I've always put them on separate drives, it's easier
2016-02-06 23:50:41	sudokode	that too!
2016-02-06 23:51:01	vimes	there is one that is 100MB with the type "EFI System", correct? 
2016-02-06 23:51:04	sudokode	GaivsIvlivs: on multiple drives, it is easier
2016-02-06 23:51:11	grawity	vimes: yes
2016-02-06 23:51:14	vimes	woho!
2016-02-06 23:51:15	alad	parabola even has patches to "rename Linux -> GNU/Linux"
2016-02-06 23:51:15	sudokode	on a single drive, having more than one is kinda messy

2016-02-06 23:51:29	shibari_	I'm finally done setting up arch http://i.imgur.com/Z4VO1Rw.png | I just have one question tho, how to permanetly add a fontpath? I couldn't add one specific font(aka it wasn't recognized somehow) so I have to do xset +fp path/to/font on startup, which doesn't do the job every time, so is there way to avoid this(make it permanent) ?
2016-02-06 23:51:32	alad	amazing use of effort, really
2016-02-06 23:51:42	sudokode	GaivsIvlivs: if you're using two OS's each on its own drive, then yeah
2016-02-06 23:51:56	sudokode	but dual booting from a single drive, I'd say a single ESP is cleaner
2016-02-06 23:52:08	vimes	mount it on /boot or /boot/efi
2016-02-06 23:52:11	GaivsIvlivs	Das wat I'm saying. I've always kept different OSs on separate drives
2016-02-06 23:52:15	sudokode	ah
2016-02-06 23:52:17	grawity	vimes: /boot will be easier

2016-02-06 23:59:35	vimes	see I have one 300 gb for windows, that is windows, and one 100 mb that is efi system. I assume that I just link the 300 gb windows, I'ma do that, it'll ..maybe work.

2016-02-07 00:00:39	grawity	what UUID?

2016-02-07 00:01:45	alad	Earnestea: there's some things I doubt about though, e.g right now I generate locales in the .install file
2016-02-07 00:01:48	vimes	well it's going to say where windows is, so that I can start it during boot. it's like GRUB, right?

2016-02-07 00:02:36	vimes	soo...I should just not include windows in the bootctl
2016-02-07 00:02:37	Earnestea	alad: That's fine
2016-02-07 00:02:42	grawity	it's only Arch you need to tell it about
2016-02-07 00:02:55	vimes	goodie
2016-02-07 00:03:09	sudokode	well, you would normally have to add windows to the bootloader menu, but gummiboot can autodetect a windows boot
2016-02-07 00:03:19	sudokode	it should give you an entry in the menu for it
2016-02-07 00:03:23	vimes	gummiboot? should I rather use that?
