2016-02-15 02:22:21	ratisbona	no, I meant the OS, and I was talking about hacking an ATM, as this is so far from being realistic, it's a theoretical discussion.

2016-02-15 02:23:24	ratisbona	C4 would not be an option, as you would burn the contents of the ATM, and if not, it would set free the coloring liquids that would dye the money and make it useless.
2016-02-15 02:24:34	Scot	ratisbona: I know so little about hacking that i never would have guessed that picking [a lock on] an atm would even go there. I apologize and will go back to being quiet in my corner...

2016-02-15 02:25:45	ratisbona	lol
